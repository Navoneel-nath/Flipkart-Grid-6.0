Grocery Quality detection(including packet foods and fruits, vegetables)(Flipkart Grid 6.0)
Sep 2024 - Oct 2024Sep 2024 - Oct 2024
Overview:
The Grocery Quality Detection project focuses on ensuring the highest quality standards for fruits, vegetables, and packaged foods. Our team developed an integrated system using YOLOv5 for real-time detection and classification, ensuring only the best products reach consumers.

Key Features:

CNN Model: Implemented a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for quality assessment, achieving 98% accuracy and 5% loss by evaluating attributes like color and texture.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Integrated Pytesseract and EasyOCR for brand recognition and expiry date extraction, enhancing product traceability and freshness assurance.

Robotic Automation: Designed a servo motor system with a 3D-printed robotic hand to remove unwanted items that fail to meet quality standards, streamlining the quality assurance process.

IR-Based Counting: Implemented an IR-based counting system using Arduino for efficient inventory management and precise tracking of produce.

Team Collaboration:
Worked alongside a dedicated team: Navoneel Nath, Ritish Karmakar, and Pabitra Maharana, whose expertise and commitment were key to our success.

Impact:
This project is a significant milestone in the Flipkart Grid 6.0 Robotics initiative, showcasing our commitment to leveraging technology for superior grocery quality detection and enhancing the customer experience.
